# youtube-sponsor-finder

A python script which uses the youtube API to look through the descriptions of popular videos and check if they are sponsored.
This is a way to get discount codes on products.
A simple regex is used to analyse the descriptions for sponsors.
The description is then emailed via a local smtp server.
